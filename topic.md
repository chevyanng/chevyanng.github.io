I have never been very good at using computers. I have not cared about computer technology either. 
As I get older the more I realize I need to know about computers for my work. 
I have been working with Excel and MS office alot so I am used to those. Even Excel things will still throw me for a loop.
The more I work with computers the better I get. It just takes time, practice and lots of patience. 
The class I am taking now with Professor Laurie has taught me alot and if you are in the same situition as I am I suggest you take his class, he is a great teacher.
